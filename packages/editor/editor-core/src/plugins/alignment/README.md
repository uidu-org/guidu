# Alignment plugin

The alignment plugin aligns selected nodes to the left, center, or right.

## Status

- removed droplist and used popup and menu-group

## TODO
- when changing alignment, it seems that the next node is selected instead of the current node. Seems to be related to the Focus handler in <Popup />
